Using Vim in a remote tmux session is very convenient, because you can detach the running session and resume it later without leaving Vim. This is great in situations where you login with ssh into your development machine at work or your server to continue coding after you changed your location. But suddenly, when you try to access a git+ssh remote (maybe through tpope's excellent fugitive plugin) or access the quotestar or quoteplus registers, things won't work as expected because with a new ssh connection some of your environment variables changed and Vim doesn't know about it. Fortunately tmux knows about these changes and this is where the nomad plugin kicks in. It queries tmux for the new values and updates your environment in Vim.
